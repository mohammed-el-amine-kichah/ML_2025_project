# Machine Learning Project – Adult Income & Obesity Levels Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains our team project for the National Higher School of Artificial Intelligence's Machine Learning course (Spring 2025). The project involves two key tasks:
- **Classification Task:** Analysis and prediction on the *Adult Income* dataset.
- **Regression Task:** Estimation of obesity levels based on relevant features.

Our goal is to implement, compare, and analyze the performance of several machine learning algorithms on these datasets.

## Project Objectives
- **Deepen understanding** of machine learning algorithms and their applications.
- **Implement and compare** various models including:
  - Decision Tree Learning and Random Forests
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Artificial Neural Networks (for both classification and regression)
  - Linear Regression
- **Perform a comparative analysis** of the models to evaluate their performance on both classification and regression tasks.

## Datasets
- **Adult Income Dataset:** Used for the classification task.
- **Obesity Levels Dataset:** Used for the regression task.


## Deliverables
1. **Jupyter Notebook(s):** All code is presented in clearly explained notebooks.
2. **Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, experiments, results, and discussion.
